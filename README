SUMMARY

This program prints a welcome message upon startup, and then prompts
the user for input. If it is given an 'A', then the line "Cook Before
Serving" is printed. If it is given a 'X', then the program prints
"finished." and halts. If any other character is inputed, then a '?'
is printed and the user is reprompted.


BUILING

This project must be built using the LC3 assembler and toolchain
available here:

http://tinyurl.com/dn8ko

Once the tools are build and/or installed, the project can be built
with the following commands.

$ lc3as hw5.asm

This should generate two files: hw5.sym, which is the symbol table for
the .asm file, and hw5.obj, which is the assembled object file generated
by the assembler.

The assembler will also try to warn you of any errors it encounters, but
there shouldn't be any, at least on the master branch.


RUNNING

Because the LC3 processor is a simplified and hypothetical processor
created for use in introductory-level computer architecture classes,
there is no way to run this program with actual hardware. Instead, one
must download and install the LC3 simulator available at:

http://tinyurl.com/dn8ko

Once the simulator is build and/or installed, launch it.

$ /path/to/lc3sim

The simulator will present you with a prompt. The first thing you are
going to want to do is to load the .obj file generated by the assembler.
The following commands assume you are in the same directory as the .obj
file.

(lc3sim) file hw5.obj

Now, run the program.

(lc3sim) continue

From there, the program will prompt for input and process input.

Further information can be found by running the "help" command from within
the simulator.
